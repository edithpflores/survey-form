            <h2 id="about">About</h2>
            <p>Diana, Princess of Wales, was the first wife of Prince Charles, the future king of the United Kingdom, and was the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry. Born Diana Frances Spencer, she became Lady Diana Spencer after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975. She married Charles on July 29, 1981, and after a largely unhappy union under constant scrutiny from the media, they divorced in 1996. Diana died on August 31, 1997, from injuries she sustained in a car crash in Paris. She is remembered as the “People’s Princess” because of her widespread popularity and global humanitarian efforts.</br></br>
        Although the Princess was renowned for her style and was closely associated with the fashion world, patronising and raising the profile of younger British designers, she was best known for her charitable work. During her marriage, the Princess was president or patron of over 100 charities.
        </br></br>
        Princess Diana played a significant and active role in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. She worked towards a ban on anti-personnel mines, and this campaign won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. Diana was concerned about the injuries that occurred to the landmine workers, especially children.
</br></br>
She helped raise AIDS awareness through AIDS programs and revealed to the world that victims of AIDS deserve to be treated with compassion and kindness. She played a significant role in de-stigmatizing the perceptions about people who were HIV-positive. Princess Diana allayed prejudices regarding the AIDS victims by holding and shaking hands with them.
